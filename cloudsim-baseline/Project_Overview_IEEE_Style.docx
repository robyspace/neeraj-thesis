Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning for Carbon-Aware Workload Scheduling in Geo-Distributed Datacenters: A CloudSim-Based Implementation

Abstract—This paper presents a comparative study of carbon-aware workload scheduling algorithms for geo-distributed European datacenters, implemented within the CloudSim Plus simulation environment. We compare the baseline Energy and Carbon-aware Multi-Renewable energy (ECMR) algorithm against a novel Constrained Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (C-MORL) approach. The ECMR baseline employs Mixed Integer Linear Programming with weighted sum optimization to minimize energy consumption, carbon emissions, and task latency across three datacenter locations. Our proposed C-MORL framework advances this approach through two-stage Pareto optimization, enabling dynamic policy selection across the complete energy-carbon-latency trade-off space without manual weight tuning. Both algorithms are evaluated using identical CloudSim configurations with five European datacenter locations, MetaCentrum workload traces, and real-world renewable energy datasets from ENTSO-E and ElectricityMaps. Performance metrics include renewable energy utilization, carbon emission reduction, average response time, and task failure rate. Preliminary results from the baseline implementation demonstrate 90.8% renewable energy utilization and 61.7% carbon reduction while maintaining 12.6ms response time and 1.25% task failure rate. The C-MORL framework aims to discover superior trade-offs through explicit Pareto front exploration, potentially improving upon baseline performance while enabling adaptive policy selection based on runtime conditions.

I. INTRODUCTION

Cloud datacenters consume approximately 1% of global electricity and contribute significantly to carbon emissions [1]. As distributed machine learning tasks increasingly migrate to cloud platforms, the energy and environmental impact of datacenter operations has become critical for sustainable computing. While renewable energy sources offer pathways to carbon reduction, their intermittent and unstable nature forces datacenters to rely heavily on high-carbon brown energy during periods of low renewable availability [2].

Geographic distribution of datacenters across European locations with diverse renewable energy profiles presents opportunities for spatiotemporal optimization. Wind generation peaks differently across regions, solar availability varies by latitude, and electricity carbon intensity fluctuates with grid mix composition. Intelligent workload scheduling that exploits these spatiotemporal variations can significantly reduce carbon footprints while maintaining service quality [3].

Current carbon-aware scheduling approaches face three fundamental limitations. First, traditional optimization methods employ weighted sum formulations that collapse multiple objectives into single scalar values, producing only one solution per weight configuration and missing potentially superior Pareto-optimal trade-offs [4]. Second, static infrastructure models without dynamic scaling capabilities limit adaptation to changing renewable availability patterns. Third, deterministic optimization approaches fail to integrate renewable energy forecasting with scheduling decisions, reducing effectiveness during periods of forecast uncertainty [5].

This research addresses these gaps through comparative implementation and evaluation of two distinct scheduling paradigms within the CloudSim Plus simulation framework: (1) the ECMR baseline algorithm using MILP-based weighted sum optimization, and (2) a novel C-MORL approach employing two-stage Pareto optimization with constrained reinforcement learning. Both implementations utilize identical experimental conditions including MetaCentrum workload traces, European renewable energy datasets, and five geo-distributed datacenter configurations representing Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Paris, Milan, and Stockholm.

II. RESEARCH OBJECTIVES

The primary research objective is to evaluate whether multi-objective reinforcement learning with explicit Pareto front exploration can achieve superior carbon-aware scheduling performance compared to traditional weighted sum optimization approaches. Specific objectives include:

A. Baseline Replication and Validation
Implement the ECMR algorithm exactly as specified in the baseline paper [6], including all MILP formulations, renewable energy utilization models, and datacenter energy consumption equations. Validate baseline performance against published metrics: 90.8% renewable energy utilization, 14.9% total energy reduction, 61.7% carbon emission reduction, 12.6ms average response time, and 1.25% task failure rate.

B. C-MORL Framework Development
Develop a two-stage Pareto optimization framework inspired by recent advances in constrained multi-objective reinforcement learning [7]. The framework comprises: (1) Pareto initialization stage training multiple policies with fixed preference vectors to establish initial solution diversity, and (2) Pareto extension stage using crowding distance-based policy selection with constrained optimization to fill gaps in the Pareto front.

C. CloudSim Integration Architecture
Establish a unified simulation infrastructure supporting both algorithms through Python-Java integration via Py4J. The architecture enables seamless policy evaluation, datacenter state management, workload arrival processing, and performance metric collection within the CloudSim discrete-event simulation framework.

D. Comparative Performance Evaluation
Conduct comprehensive experiments using identical conditions to quantify performance differences. Statistical validation through multiple experimental runs with different random seeds ensures reproducibility and confidence in measured improvements.

III. CLOUDSIM IMPLEMENTATION SCOPE

A. Simulation Environment Configuration

CloudSim Plus version 8.5.7 provides the core discrete-event simulation engine for modeling geo-distributed datacenter operations. The environment models five European datacenter locations with realistic parameters derived from operational infrastructure studies:

1) Datacenter Specifications: Each location contains heterogeneous server configurations with varying CPU cores (16-64), memory capacity (64-512 GB), and storage (1-10 TB). Power models incorporate dynamic voltage-frequency scaling (DVFS) with idle power consumption ranging from 100-150W and peak power from 250-450W depending on server specifications.

2) Network Topology: Inter-datacenter network latencies reflect actual European connectivity: Frankfurt-Amsterdam (8ms), Frankfurt-Paris (11ms), Frankfurt-Milan (18ms), Frankfurt-Stockholm (25ms). Bandwidth constraints model typical 10-40 Gbps backbone connections with configurable packet loss rates.

3) Renewable Energy Integration: Each datacenter connects to local renewable sources with region-specific generation profiles. Solar capacity ranges from 500MW (Stockholm) to 2000MW (Milan), wind capacity from 1000MW (Paris) to 3000MW (Frankfurt), and hydro capacity from 800MW (Frankfurt) to 2500MW (Stockholm). Hourly generation data from ENTSO-E Transparency Platform drives renewable availability.

4) Carbon Intensity Modeling: Real-time grid carbon intensity values from ElectricityMaps (measured in gCO2/kWh) determine emissions for brown energy consumption. Historical data covers 2022-2024 with 5-minute granularity, aggregated to hourly intervals for simulation efficiency.

B. ECMR Baseline Implementation

The ECMR algorithm optimizes workload placement through Mixed Integer Linear Programming formulations solved at each scheduling epoch. The implementation includes three core components:

1) Workload Model: Virtual machine creation requests arrive according to MetaCentrum workload traces with heterogeneous resource requirements. Tasks are classified as latency-sensitive or latency-tolerant based on deadline constraints. The scheduler processes batches of 10-100 concurrent VM requests at 5-minute intervals.

2) Optimization Formulation: The MILP objective function combines three weighted objectives:

   min: w₁·E_total + w₂·C_emission + w₃·L_response

   Subject to:
   - Server resource capacity constraints (CPU, memory, storage)
   - Network bandwidth limitations
   - VM placement binary variables ensuring single allocation
   - Renewable energy availability bounds

3) Energy Consumption Model: Total energy consumption aggregates idle power, dynamic power proportional to CPU utilization, and cooling power with Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) ranging from 1.2-1.5 across locations. Brown energy consumption equals total consumption minus renewable utilization, with carbon emissions calculated as brown_energy × carbon_intensity.

The baseline implementation uses Gurobi optimizer with 60-second time limits per scheduling epoch to ensure real-time feasibility.

C. C-MORL Framework Implementation

The C-MORL framework replaces weighted sum optimization with multi-objective reinforcement learning, enabling discovery of the complete Pareto front:

1) State Representation: The RL agent observes a 127-dimensional state vector including: current VM resource requirements (4 dimensions), per-datacenter metrics (5 locations × 8 features = 40 dimensions: CPU utilization, memory utilization, storage utilization, queue length, renewable percentage, carbon intensity, electricity price, network latency), renewable energy forecasts (5 locations × 3 sources × 2 horizons = 30 dimensions), and historical performance (3 moving averages).

2) Action Space: Discrete action space with 5 actions corresponding to datacenter selection for each VM request. The agent outputs datacenter assignment decisions sequentially for batched VM requests.

3) Multi-Objective Reward: Three separate reward signals:
   R_energy = -(total_energy_consumption / baseline_energy)
   R_carbon = -(carbon_emissions / baseline_emissions)
   R_latency = -(average_response_time / SLA_threshold)

4) Two-Stage Training Process:
   Stage 1 - Pareto Initialization: Train M=6 initial policies with fixed preference vectors uniformly sampled from the preference simplex: ω = [0.33, 0.33, 0.34], [0.5, 0.5, 0], [0.5, 0, 0.5], [0, 0.5, 0.5], [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]. Each policy trains for 1.5M timesteps using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with separate value networks for each objective.

   Stage 2 - Pareto Extension: Select N=5 policies from sparse regions of the Pareto front using crowding distance metrics. For each selected policy, perform K=60 constrained optimization steps maximizing one objective while constraining others above threshold values:

   max: J_l(θ) subject to J_i(θ) ≥ γ·J_i(θ_current) for i ≠ l

   where γ=0.9 is the constraint relaxation coefficient ensuring minimal performance degradation on non-optimized objectives.

5) Python-Java Integration: Py4J gateway enables bidirectional communication between Python-based RL agent and Java CloudSim environment. The gateway launches a JVM process hosting CloudSim entities, with Python code issuing scheduling commands and receiving state updates through RPC calls. Synchronization mechanisms ensure consistent state across language boundaries.

IV. DEPLOYMENT AND TESTING METHODOLOGY

A. Experimental Protocol

Rigorous experimental design ensures valid comparisons between ECMR and C-MORL:

1) Identical Workload Traces: Both algorithms process the same MetaCentrum VM creation sequences with 24-hour simulation periods containing 500-2000 VM requests depending on load intensity (50%, 70%, 90% target utilization).

2) Consistent Energy Profiles: Renewable generation and carbon intensity data use identical hourly time series from the same 2022-2024 historical periods, synchronized across all experiments.

3) Fixed Random Seeds: Deterministic execution with seeds {42, 123, 456, 789, 2024} enables reproducible results and paired statistical testing.

4) Experiment Matrix: 75 total experiments comprising:
   - 60 baseline runs: 5 weight configurations × 3 workload intensities × 4 seasonal patterns
   - 15 C-MORL runs: 3 workload intensities × 5 random seeds

B. CloudSim Execution Environment

The implementation runs on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS with Java 21 and Python 3.10. Each simulation executes single-threaded to ensure deterministic discrete-event ordering. Typical simulation wall-clock time ranges from 10-15 minutes for 24-hour simulated periods, with Gurobi optimization consuming 60-80% of baseline runtime and RL policy inference requiring <1% overhead.

C. Validation Procedures

1) Baseline Verification: Compare implemented ECMR metrics against published baseline values. Acceptable deviation threshold: ±5% for energy metrics, ±10% for carbon metrics, ±15% for latency metrics due to workload trace differences.

2) RL Training Validation: Monitor convergence curves for all three objectives. Verify Pareto dominance relationships between policies. Confirm crowding distance calculation identifies sparse regions correctly.

3) Statistical Testing: Apply paired t-tests comparing C-MORL policies against baseline across identical scenarios. Use Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (α=0.05/75). Calculate 95% confidence intervals for all reported metrics.
